Project [deno-tree-sitter](https://github.com/jeff-hykin/deno-tree-sitter/) contains several patches and extensions over
web-tree-sitter. Unfortunately deno-tree-sitter is not available as npm package and cannot be used with nodejs.
Therefor we add it as submodule and package inside @kerebron/tree-sitter
